### What is GitHub?

- GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

### Step 1. Create a Repository

- A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.
